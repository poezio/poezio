Plugins
=======

Starting from the 0.7.5 version, poezio supports plugins.
Here is a quick howto and a plugin index.


Setting up plugins
------------------


Poezio seeks the plugins in the :file:`~/.local/share/poezio/plugins/` dir (more
generally, the :file:`$XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/plugins/` dir), but that can be changed
by setting the :term:`plugins_dir` option to the directory where you want to
put your plugins.

By default, poezio will also seek the plugins in :file:`../plugins`, in the source
directory, in order to always load the latest versions. You should put a plugin
in :file:`$XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/plugins` only if you have a custom version (that
will override the one in :file:`../plugins`), or if it is a plugin you made.


Plugin autoload
---------------

Use the :term:`plugins_autoload` option to select which plugins should be
loaded on startup. The value is a list of plugin names separated by colons,
e.g.

.. code-block:: ini

    plugins_autoload = tell:exec

Manual plugin load
------------------

Plugins can of course be loaded with the command :term:`/load` and unloaded
with the command :term:`/unload`.

.. _plugin-configuration:

Plugin configuration
--------------------

Most plugins will manage their configuration internally, and you do not (and
should not) have to edit it, but some (e.g. mpd_client) require manual
editing (the :term:`/set` command can be used, but it is not pleasant to set
multiple values with it).

The plugin configuration directory is located in :file:`~/.config/poezio/plugins/`
(or :file:`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/poezio/plugins/`) and the file related to a specific
plugin is named :file:`plugin_name.cfg`. The configuration options should usually be
inside a section named after the plugin (sections are delimited with ``[]``).

.. code-block:: ini

    [plugin_name]
    key = value
    other_key = other_value
