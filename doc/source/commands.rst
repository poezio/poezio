Commands
========

Commands start with the ``/`` character and can take a list of any number
of arguments, separated by spaces. If an argument should contain a space,
you can use the ``"`` character to surround this argument.

The commands described in this page are shown like this:

``/command <mandatory argument> [optional argument]``

You can get the same help as below from inside poezio with the :term:`/help` command.

.. note:: Use command parameters like this:

    - Do not use quotes if they are unnecessary (words without special chars or spaces)
    - If the command takes several arguments, you need to put quotes around arguments containing special chars such as backslashes or quotes
    - If the command always takes only one argument, then do not use quotes even for words containing special chars

    /help
        **Usage:** ``/help [command]``

        If called without an argument, this command will list the
        available commands. If it has a valid command as an argument, this command
        will show the usage and the help for the given command.

    /join
        **Usage:** ``/join [room_name][@server][/nick] [password]``

        Join the specified room. You
        can specify a nickname after a slash (/). If no nickname is specified, you
        will use the default_nick in the configuration file. You can omit the room
        name: you will then join the room you're looking at (useful if you were
        kicked). You can also provide a room_name without specifying a server, the
        server of the room you're currently in will be used. You can also provide a
        password to join the room.

        *Examples:*

        - ``/join room@server.tld``
        - ``/join room@server.tld/John``

        is not parameter is given and the current tab is a chatroom.

        You need to be the owner of a room or a server admin to destroy it.

    /win
    /w
        **Usage:** ``/win <number or string>``

        Go to the matching tab.  If the argument is a number, it goes to the tab with that number.
        Otherwise, it goes to the next tab whose name contains the given string.

    /wup

        **Usage:** ``/wup <prefix>``

        Go to the tab whose name starts with `prefix`. If multiple tabs start
        with that prefix, no action is taken.

        (Mnemonic: Window by Unique Prefix)

    /status
        **Usage:** ``/status <availability> [status message]``

        Set your availability and
        (optionally) your status message. The <availability> argument is one of
        "available, chat, away, afk, dnd, busy, xa" and the optional [status] argument
        will be your status message.'

    /bookmark
        **Usage:** ``/bookmark [roomname][/nick] [autojoin] [password]``

        Bookmark the specified
        room. This command uses  almost the same syntax as /join. Type ``/help join`` for
        syntax examples. Note that when typing /bookmark on its own, the room will be
        bookmarked with the nickname you're currently using in this room (instead of
        default_nick). You can specify an optional *autojoin* and *password* if you
        call it with the full line (/bookmark alone will put the room in autojoin
        without password). The bookmarks stored with this command are stored on your
        xmpp server.

    /bookmark_local
        **Usage:** ``/bookmark_local [roomname][/nick]``

        Bookmark the  specified room (you will
        then auto-join it on each poezio start). This commands uses almost the same
        syntax as /join. Type /help join for syntax examples. Note that when typing
        /bookmark on its own, the room will be bookmarked with the nickname you're
        currently using in this room (instead of default_nick). The bookmarks stored
        with this command will be stored locally. They have priority over the ones
        stored online.

    /remove_bookmark
        **Usage:** ``/remove_bookmark [room_jid]``

        Remove the bookmark on *room_jid* or the one on the current tab, if any.

    /set
        **Usage:** ``/set [plugin|][section] <option> <value>``

        Set the value to the option in
        your configuration file. You can, for example, change your default nickname
        by doing "/set default_nick toto" or your password with "/set password
        blabla".  Doing so will write in the main config file, and in the main
        section ([Poezio]). But you can also write to another section, with ``/set
        bindings M-i ^i``, to a plugin configuration with ``/set mpd_client| host
        main`` (notice the **|**, it is mandatory to write in a plugin), or even to
        another section in a plugin configuration ``/set plugin|other_section option
        value``.  **toggle** can be used as a special value for a boolean option. It
        just set the option to true if it’s currently false, and to false if it’s
        currently true.

    /set_default
        **Usage:** ``/set_default [section] <option>``

        Set the value of an option back to the default. For example,
        ``/set_default password`` will reset the ``password`` option.

    /toggle
        **Usage:** ``/toggle <option>``

        Toggle an option, shortcut for :term:`/set` <option> toggle.

    /move_tab
        **Usage:** ``/move_tab <source> <destination>``

        Move tab <source> to <destination>. If the :term:`create_gaps` option
        is true, then it will leave a gap at the <source> position, leading
        to usual behaviour. If create_gaps is not enabled, then the tabs will
        number from 0 to your actual tab number, without gaps (which means
        their number will change if you close a tab on the left of the list).

        A value of ``.`` for a parameter means the current tab.

    /theme
        **Usage:** ``/theme [theme_name]``

        Reload the theme defined in the config file. If
        *theme_name* is given, this command will act like :samp:`/set theme {theme_name}` then
