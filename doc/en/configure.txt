Configure
=========

The configuration is located in the file *~/.config/poezio/poezio.cfg*
On its first startup, poezio will create that file (and its containing
directories) with the default configuration. You can edit that file manually
or use the */set* command to edit some of its values directly from poezio.
This file is also used to configure key bindings, but this is explained
in the _keys_ documentation file.

That file is read at each startup and the configuration is saved when poezio
is closed.

This configuration file *requires* all global options to be in a section
named [Poezio]. Some other options can be in optional sections and will
apply only to tabs having the option’s name.

An option is formatted with the form
======================
option = value
======================

An empty value *doesn’t* mean that the default value will be used. That’s
just an empty value. To use the default value, just comment or remove the
option entirely.

Here is a list of all the avalaible configuration options, their meaning
and their default value.

Configuration options
---------------------

Global section options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These option have a sense when they are in the global section. Some of
them can also be in an optional configuration section, see the next
section of this documentation.

[horizontal]
*server*:: anon.louiz.org

  The server to use for *anonymous* authentication.
  Make sure it accepts anonymous authentification
  Note that this option doesn’t do anything at all if you’re using your own JID.

*port*:: 5222

 The port you’ll use to connect.

*certificate*:: [empty]

  The fingerprint of the SSL certificate as a hexadecimal string, you should
  not touch it, except if know what you are doing.

*ignore_certificate*:: false

  Skip certificate validation on connection when _true_. Useful when you are in
  anonymous mode and changing servers often. Dangerous in other cases, from a
  security perspective.

*ca_cert_path*:: [empty]

  Path to the certificate of the Certification Authority.
  As some services may keep different certificates, it is an alternative to
  the Trust On First Use model provided by _certificate_. This option is not
  affected by _ignore_certificate_ and boths checks may be active at the same
  time.

*whitespace_interval*:: 300

  Interval of the whitespace keepalive sending to the server.
  300 should be fine, but change it if some services have a stricter policy
  on client inactivity.

*resource*:: [empty]

  the resource you will use
  If it's empty, your resource will be chosen (most likely randomly) by the server
  It is not recommended to use a resource that is easy to guess, because it can lead
  to presence leak.

*auto_reconnect*:: false

  Auto-reconnects you when you get disconnected. Should not be necessary, so
  the default is false.


*default_nick*:: [empty]

  the nick you will use when joining a room with no associated nick
  If this is empty, the $USER environnement variable will be used


*jid*:: [empty]

  Jabber identifiant. Specify it only if you want to connect using an existing
  account on a server. This is optional and useful only for some features,
  like room administration, nickname registration.
  The 'server' option will be ignored if you specify a JID (Jabber identifiant)
  It should be in the form nickname@server.tld

*password*:: [empty]

  A password is needed only if you specified a jid. It will be ignored otherwise
  If you leave this empty, the password will be asked at each startup

*rooms*:: poezio@muc.poezio.eu

  the rooms you will join automatically on startup, with associated nickname or not
  format : room@server.tld/nickname:room2@server.tld/nickname2
  default_nick will be used if "/nickname" is not specified

*use_bookmark_method*:: [empty]

    the method that poezio will use to store your bookmarks online.
    possible values are: privatexml, pep
    You should not have to edit this in a normal use case.

*use_remote_bookmarks*:: true

    use this option to force the use of local bookmarks if needed.
    Anything but "false" will be counted as true.

*completion*:: normal

  the completion type you will use to complete nicknames
  if "normal", complete the entire name to the first available completion
  and then cycle through the possible completion with the next TABs
  if "shell", if there's more than one nick for this completion, complete
  only the part that all then nicks have in common (like in a shell)


*after_completion*:: ,

  what will be put after the name, when using autocompletion
  a SPACE will always be added after that

*highlight_on*:: [empty]

  a list of words (separated by a colon (:)) that will be
  highlighted if said by someone on a room

*enable_xhtml_im*:: true

  XHTML-IM is an XMPP extension letting users send messages
  containing XHTML and CSS formating. We can use this to make
  colored text for example.
  It is disabled by default because this is only in an experimental
  state: you could miss some part of a message (mainly the URL)
  but you can still send colored messages. You just won’t be able te see
  the colors, though
  Set to true if you want to see colored messages

*hide_status_change*:: 120

  Set a number for this setting.
  The join OR status-change notices will be
  displayed according to this number.
  -1: the notices will ALWAYS be displayed
   0: the notices will NEVER be displayed
   n: On any other number, the notices will only be displayed
      if the user involved has talked since the last n seconds
  if the value is incorrect, -1 is assumed
  Default setting means :
   - status changes won't be displayed unless
     the user talked in the last 2 minutes

*hide_exit_join*:: -1

  Exact same thing than hide_status_change, except that it concerns
  the quit message, and that it will be hidden only if the value is 0.
  Default setting means:
   - all quit and join notices will be displayed

*send_initial_presence*:: true

 Send initial presence (normal behaviour). If false, you will not send nor
 receive any presence that is not directed (through /presence) or sent by a
 MUC.

*display_user_color_in_join_part*:: false

  If set to true, the color of the nick will be used in MUCs information
  messages, instead of the default color from the theme.

*information_buffer_popup_on*:: error roster warning help info

  Some informational messages (error, a contact getting connected, etc)
  are sometimes added to the information buffer. These settings can make
  that buffer grow temporarly so you can read these information when they
  appear.

  A list of message types that should make the information buffer grow
  Possible values; error, roster, warning, info, help

*popup_time*:: 4

  The time the message will be visible in the information buffer when it
  pops up.

  room when you're kicked

*alternative_nickname*:: [empty]

  If you want poezio to join
  the room with an alternative nickname when
  your nickname is already in use in the room you
  wanted to join, put a non-empty value.
  Else, poezio won't join the room
  This value will be added to your nickname to
  create the alternative nickname.
  For example, if you set "\_", and wanted to use
  the nickname "john", your alternative nickname
  will be "john_"

*muc_history_length*:: 50

  Limit the number of messages you want to receive when the
  multiuserchat rooms send you recent history
  0: You won't receive any
  -1: You will receive the maximum

  in files.


*log_dir*:: [empty]

  If log_dir is not set, logs will be saved in $XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/logs,

*show_muc_jid*:: true
