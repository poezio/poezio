OTR
===

*DISCLAIMER: THE OTR LIB IS IN AN EXPERIMENTAL STATE AND SHOULD NOT BE
CONSIDERED AS ENTIRELY RELIABLE*

('though it works pretty well')

This plugin implements http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/OTR[Off The Record messaging].

This is a plugin used to encrypt one-to-one conversation using the OTR
encryption method. You can use it if you want good privacy, deniability,
authentication, and strong secrecy. Without this
encryption, your messages are encrypted *at least* from your client (poezio) to
your server. The message is decrypted by your server and you cannot control the
encryption method of your messages from your server to your contact’s server
(unless you are your own server’s administrator), nor from your contact’s
server to your contact’s client.

This plugin does end-to-end encryption. This means that *only* your contact can
decrypt your messages, and it is fully encrypted during *all* its travel
through the internet.

Note that if you are having an encrypted conversation with a contact, you can
*not* send XHTML-IM messages to him. They will be removed and be replaced by
plain text messages.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

To use the OTR plugin, you must first install libopenotr.

If you use Archlinux, there is a https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57957[libopenotr-git] package on the AUR.

 cd libopenotr

==============================================

then run autogen.sh and configure

==========

The status of the OTR encryption should appear in the bar between the chat and
the input "OTR: encrypted".


Once you’re done, end the OTR session with

==========

 /otr end
