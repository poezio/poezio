Poezio plugins
==============

Starting from the 0.7.5 version, poezio supports plugins.
Here is a quick howto and a plugin index.


Setting up plugins
------------------
Poezio seeks the plugins in the _~/.local/share/poezio/plugins/_ dir (more
generally, the _$XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/plugins/_ dir), but that can be changed
by setting the _plugins_dir_ option in the
link:../configure.html[configuration file] to the directory where you want to
put your plugins.


Plugins autostart
-----------------
Use the _plugins_autoload_ option (from the
link:../configure.html[configuration file]) to select which plugins should be
loaded on startup. The value is a list of plugin names separated by spaces,
e.g.

.plugins_autoload example
---------
plugins_autoload = "gpg tell exec"
---------

Plugins configuration
---------------------
Most plugins will manage their configuration internally, and you do not (and
should not) have to edit it, but some (e.g. mpd_client or gpg) require manual
editing (the _/set_ command can be used, but it is not pleasant to set
multiple values with it).

The plugin configuration directory is located in _~/.config/poezio/plugins/_
(or _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/poezio/plugins/_) and the file related to a specific
plugin is named _plugin_name.cfg_. The configuration options should usually be
inside a section named after the plugin (sections are delimited with _[]_).

.section example
--------------
[plugin_name]
key = value
other_key = other_value
