Plugins
=======

Location
--------

The plugins have to be present in '$XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/plugins/plugin_name.py'
(or '~/.local/share' if not defined)

Structure
---------

A plugin must always be a class named Plugin that inherits the
plugin.BasePlugin class defined into the *plugin* poezio module.

Methods
-------

Overridden methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *Plugin* class has several method that you can override for your own
 convenience

[[init]]
*init*:: +self+ +
This method is called when the plugin is loaded, this is where you call
the other methods, for example <<add-command,add_command>>, and initialize
everything to make your plugin actually do something. <<example-1,ex 1>>,
 <<example-2,ex 2>>

*cleanup*:: +self+ +
Called when the plugin is unloaded (or when poezio is exited). Clean everything
that needs to be cleaned here.

Callable methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The BasePlugin has several methods that can be used. Here is a list of
all its methods that you could use in your plugin, describing what they
do, their arguments, and giving some example for each of them.

[[add-command]]
*add_command*:: +self+, +name+, +handler+, +help+, +completion=None+ + 
This method adds a global command to poezio. For example you can add a /foo
command that the user could call when the plugin is loaded, by calling this
method with _foo_ as its _name_ argument. <<example-1,ex 1>>

* _name_: (string) the name of the command (for example, if it is 'plugintest',
 it can add a /plugintest command)
* _handler_: (function) the function to be called when the command is executed.
the handler takes *args* as a parameter, which is a string of what
is entered after the command. Split *args* (with _common.shell_split_) to use
that as command arguments.
* _help_: (string) the help message available for that command through the
 _/help_ command.
* _completion_: (function) the completion for the args of that command. It
 takes an input object as its only argument. This function should call the
_auto_completion()_ method on the input object, passing a list of possible
 strings for the completion and returning the value of that call directly.
Everything else is handled by that _auto_completion()_ method (checking what
 strings match, how to cycle between matches, etc). If you don’t want any
 special completion for that command, just pass None (the default value).

*del_command*:: +self+, +name+ +
This method removes a command added by your plugin.

* _name_: (string) the name of the command you want to remove.

*add_key*:: +self+, +key+, +handler+ +
This method adds a global keyboard shortcut on _key_ that will call _handler_.
You can get the keys with _python3 src/keyboard.py_.

* _key_: String representing the key press in curses.
* _handler_: Method called whenever _key_ is pressed.

*del_key*:: +self+, +key+ +
This method deletes a keyboard shortcut previously added by your plugin.

* _key_: String representing the key press in curses.

*add_tab_key*:: +self+, +tab_type+, +key+, +handler+ +
This method adds a tab-custom command to poezio. For example you can add _^G_
keybind that the user could call in a specific tab when the plugin is loaded.

* _tab_type_: You have to _import tabs_ in order to get tabs types. The
 following are possible:
** _tabs.MucTab_: The MultiUserChat tabs
** _tabs.PrivateTab_: The Private tabs
** _tabs.ConversationTab_: The Roster tab
** _tabs.RosterInfoTab_: The MultiUserChat, Private, and Conversation tabs
** _tabs.ChatTab_: The MultiUserChat, Private, and Conversation tabs
** _tabs.MucListTab_: The MultiUserChat list tabs
* _key_: (string) the curses representation of the keypress (see  above).
* _handler_: (function) the handler to be called when the keypress is found.

*del_tab_command*:: +self+, +tab_type+, +key+
This method removes a tab command added by your plugin.

* _key_: (string) the name of the keybind you want to remove.
* _tab_type_: the type of tab (see help for _add_key_command_)

*add_tab_command*:: +self+, +tab_type+, +name+, +handler+, +help+, +completion+ +
This method adds a tab-custom command to poezio. For example you can add a /dou
command that the user could call in a specific tab when the plugin is loaded.

* _tab_type_: You have to _import tabs_ in order to get tabs types. The
 following are possible:
** _tabs.MucTab_: The MultiUserChat tabs
** _tabs.PrivateTab_: The Private tabs
** _tabs.ConversationTab_: The Roster tab
** _tabs.RosterInfoTab_: The MultiUserChat, Private, and Conversation tabs
** _tabs.ChatTab_: The MultiUserChat, Private, and Conversation tabs
** _tabs.MucListTab_: The MultiUserChat list tabs
* _name_: (string) the name of the command (for example, if it is 'plugintest',
 it can add a /plugintest command)
* _handler_: (function) the function to be called when the command is executed.
the handler takes *args* as a parameter, which is a string of what
is entered after the command. Split *args* (with _common.shell_split_) to use
that as command arguments.
* _help_: (string) the help message available for that command through the
 _/help_ command.
* _completion_: (function) the completion for the args of that command. It
 takes an input object as its only argument. This function should call the
_auto_completion()_ method on the input object, passing a list of possible
 strings for the completion and returning the value of that call directly.
Everything else is handled by that _auto_completion()_ method (checking what
 strings match, how to cycle between matches, etc). If you don’t want any
 special completion for that command, just pass None (the default value).

*del_tab_command*:: +self+, +tab_type+, +name+
This method removes a tab command added by your plugin.

* _name_: (string) the name of the command you want to remove.
* _tab_type_: the type of tab (see help for _add_tab_command_)

*add_event_handler**: +self+, +event_name+, +handler+ +position+
This methods adds a callback that will be called whenever the given event
occurs. <<example-2,ex 2>>

* _event_name_: (string) The name of the event you want to ``monitor''.
This can be a sleekxmpp event, or a poezio event. See the list of
<<events-list,all available events>>.
* _handler_: The method that will be called whenever the event occurs.
It must accept the arguments specified for that event in the
 <<events-list,events list>>.
* _position_: Optional, this argument will specify the position of the handler
 in the handler list for this event. It is 0 by default, and will only be used
 with the internal poezio events described below.



Attributes
----------

Config
~~~~~~
By default, each plugin has a PluginConfig object accessible with *self.config*.

*PluginConfig.read*:: +self+ + 
Reads the config file from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/poezio/plugins/plugin_name.cfg, it
 is called upon initialization, so you should not need it.

*PluginConfig.write*:: +self+ +
Writes the config to the same file mentioned previously.

Core
~~~~
Each plugin has a reference to the Core object accessible with *self.core*,
 that allows you to do about anything with poezio. Remember to use it only when
 you need it, and to use the functions described in this documentation only,
 even if much more is available. If your plugin needs to do something not
 available with these methods, please do a feature request instead of doing
 some dirty hacks with some other methods.

Poezio events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*muc_say*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you say something in a MUC
 (through the /say command or by direct input). The parameters given to the
 handlers are:

* _message_: Message to be sent.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message will be sent.

*muc_say_after*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you say something in a MUC
 (through the /say command or by direct input). The difference with muc_say is
 just that *muc_say_after* hook is called AFTER the xhtm-im body has been
 generated. So you *MUST* not insert any color attribute in the body using this
 hook. The hook is less safe that *muc_say* and most of the time you should not
 use it at all. The parameters given to the  handlers are:

* _message_: Message to be sent.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message will be sent.

*private_say*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you say something in a private
 conversaton in a MUC (through the /say command or by direct input). The
 parameters given to the handlers are:

* _message_: Message to be sent.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message will be sent.

*private_say_after*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you say something in a MUC
 (through the /say command or by direct input). The difference with private_say
 is just that *private_say_after* hook is called AFTER the xhtm-im body has
 been generated and the message has been displayed on the conversation, this
 means that if you modify the body, the message that will be sent will not be
 the same that the one displayed in the text buffer. So you *MUST* not insert
 any color attribute in the body using this hook. The hook is less safe that
 *private_say* and most of the time you should not use it at all. The
 parameters given to the handlers are:

* _message_: Message to be sent.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message will be sent.

*conversation_say*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you say something in direct
 conversation (through the /say command or by direct input). The parameters
 given to the handler are:

* _message_: Message to be sent.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message will be sent.

*conversation_say_after*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you say something in a MUC
 (through the /say command or by direct input). The difference with
 *conversation_say* is just that *conversation_say_after* hook is called AFTER
 the xhtm-im body has been generated and the message has been displayed on the
 conversation, this means that if you modify the body, the message that will be
 sent will not be the same that the one displayed in the text buffer. So you
 *MUST* not insert any color attribute in the body using this hook. The hook is
 less safe that *conversation_say* and most of the time you should not use it at
 all. The parameters given to the handlers are:

* _message_: Message to be sent.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message will be sent.

*muc_msg*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you receive a message in a MUC.
 The parameters given to the handler are:

* _message_: Message received.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message was received.

*private_msg*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you receive a message in a
 private conversation in a MUC. The parameters given to the handler are:

* _message_: Message received.

*conversation_msg*:: +message+, +tab+ +
The handlers for this event are called whenever you receive a message in a
 direct conversation. The parameters given to the handler are:

* _message_: Message received.
* _tab_: Tab in which the message was received.

*normal_chatstate*:: +message+, +tab+ +
