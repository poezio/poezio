Hello, thank you for contributing to poezio!

You’re about to open a pull request on github. However this github repository is *not* the official
place for contributions on poezio.

Please open your merge request on https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/poezio/

You should be able to log in there with your github credentials, clone the poezio repository in your namespace,
push your existing pull request into a new branch, and then open a merge request with one click, within 3 minutes.

This will help us review your contribution, avoid spreading things everywhere and it will even run the tests
automatically with your changes.

Thank you.
